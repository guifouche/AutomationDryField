# AutomationDryField

## Getting started
First install :
    **Node Js**
     **npm**
     **mongoDb**

Run `npm install`

Then simply run the command `npm start` in main directory to automatically install and launch the app.

Run `npm run dev` for dev mode (installing devDependencies)

Run `npm test` to see tests output.

Finally, run `npm run run` to skip the install part!
